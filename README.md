Deploy a proxy for OpenWhisk web actions to map an OpenWhisk namespace to a subdomain name.
For background, read my [article on Medium](https://medium.com/@rabbah/semi-custom-domains-for-openwhisk-web-apps-1ef1bd5bc437).
To deploy the proxy, see the instructions in [cf/router](cf/router). And to deploy the adminstrative operations, see the instructions in [wsk/package/router](wsk/package/router).
